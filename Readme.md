# Remote Piscine-like Challenge Repository

Welcome to the Remote Piscine-like Challenge Repository! This repository aims to provide a similar experience to the piscine, but with some differences that cater to the remote and self-paced nature of this challenge.

## Differences from Piscine
You'll complete the challenge remotely and at your own pace, requiring more discipline and focus.

- There's no XP for completing projects, but you can showcase them on your personal GitHub and during job interviews.

- Instead of learning C like in the piscine, you can use any programming language to complete the challenges.

Despite these differences, the goal remains the same: learn by doing and communicate with others to complete tasks. This is a great opportunity to experience what it's like to be a developer in today's remote work environment.

## How It Works
The first major project focuses on web development, which offers the most job opportunities. The project is divided into chapters:

1. FrontEnd
2. BackEnd
3. Database
4. DevOps

Each chapter contains exercises, allowing you to build the final project by combining what you've learned.

Exercises and chapters will be released daily. While each chapter covers an extensive topic, the objective is to learn the basics and how to learn independently. This way, you can tackle the final project by knowing where and how to find the best solutions.

## Getting Started
You'll use the command line extensively, as you did in the piscine. It's recommended to install a Linux virtual machine, use the MacOS terminal, or use the built-in Linux terminal on Windows. Choose your preferred option and set up your environment.


Next, clone this repository and create a new branch with your piscine username:

```
git checkout -b <your_piscine_username>
```

The project structure is as follows:

```
<Project_name>/<chapter_name>/<ex_number>
Example: web/backend/ex00
````

You don't need to create folders. Each exercise folder (e.g., `ex00`) will contain a `Readme.md` with instructions and a test file. Run your program and then run the test file. If it passes, you can commit and push your exercise.

Each chapter will also include optional additional content to enhance your learning.

## Have Fun!
Remember, there's no magic formula to becoming a good programmer. Just study, practice, and stay focused (and avoid any questionable substances ðŸ˜‰). Good luck, and enjoy the challenge!s
