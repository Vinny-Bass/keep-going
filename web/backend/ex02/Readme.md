<b>Goal</b>: In any language, create a file that runs a server on the 3000 port, this server should have a route as following `/batman`, and should be able to receive a GET request and return data on data.json file located on this repo.

<b>How to test</b>: 

After you run your server just run:
```
./test_script.sh
```

```
chmod +x ./test_script
